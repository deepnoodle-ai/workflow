# Product Requirements Document: Workflow Automation Library

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the requirements for developing a production-ready
workflow automation library in Go. The library will provide a simpler
alternative to complex workflow engines while maintaining essential enterprise
features including parallel execution, failure recovery, and extensibility.

## Product Vision

Create a Go workflow automation library that enables developers to build
reliable, scalable automation processes with minimal complexity. The library
should be generic enough to support various use cases including AI agent
workflows, data processing pipelines, and business process automation.

## Core Requirements

#### R1: Graph-Based Workflow Topology

Support complex workflow structures with branching and merging:

- Directed graph representation
- Conditional branching based on step results
- Support for parallel execution paths

#### R2: Step Types and Operations

Support for external operations through pluggable actions:

- Standardized action interface
- Parameter templating with workflow state
- Action registry for discoverability
- Built-in actions for common operations

#### R2.2: Script Steps

Enable custom logic through safe script execution:

- Sandboxed script execution environment
- Access to workflow state and inputs
- Support for common data transformations
- Timeout and resource controls

#### R2.3: Control Flow Steps

Support advanced control flow constructs:

- Loop constructs (for-each, while)
- Conditional steps (if/else, switch)
- Error handling and retry logic
- Wait/delay steps with timeouts

#### R3: Execution Engine

Support concurrent execution of workflow paths:

- Multiple execution paths per workflow
- Path isolation and state management
- Deadlock detection and prevention

#### R3.1: State Management

Reliable state tracking throughout workflow execution:

- Thread-safe state operations
- JSON-serializable state format
- State versioning and migration
- Cross-path state synchronization

#### R3.3: Operation Tracking

Track all operations for debugging and audit:

- Deterministic operation IDs
- Operation parameter and result logging
- Performance metrics collection
- Audit trail for compliance

### R4: Failure Recovery and Resilience

#### R4.1: Checkpoint-Based Recovery

Enable workflow resumption from failures:

- Automatic checkpoint creation
- Configurable checkpoint frequency
- Fast recovery from checkpoints
- Checkpoint cleanup and retention

#### R4.2: Error Handling and Retry

Robust error handling with configurable retry policies:

- Automatic retry for transient failures
- Exponential backoff with jitter
- Circuit breaker pattern for external services
- Custom error handling strategies

#### R4.3: Timeout and Resource Management

Prevent resource exhaustion and hanging operations:

- Configurable timeouts for all operations
- Memory and CPU usage monitoring
- Graceful shutdown procedures
- Resource cleanup on failures

### R5: Observability and Monitoring

#### R5.1: Structured Logging

Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring:

- Structured log output (JSON format)
- Configurable log levels
- Correlation IDs for tracing
- Integration with popular logging frameworks

#### R5.2: Debugging Support

Tools and features to aid in workflow debugging:

- Step-by-step execution tracing
- Variable inspection at each step
- Execution visualization tools
- Replay capability for debugging

#### R6: Storage Backend Abstraction

Support multiple storage backends for state and checkpoints:
- Pluggable storage interface
- File system storage implementation

#### R6.3: Event System

Enable workflow events for integration and monitoring:

- Workflow lifecycle events
- Step execution events
- Error and recovery events
- Custom event types
